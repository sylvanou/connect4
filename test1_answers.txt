1. How do we measure the length of the critical rendering path? (10 pts)  
    1. The number of server round trips your page must do in order to fully load and render  
    2. The number of actions the browser must take (eg run js, build cssom, build dom, etc) in order to fully load and render your page  
    3. By counting the number of all external resources that must be loaded  
    4. By counting the number of render-blocking external resources that must be loaded 

    // Answer. Number 2. 

2. What are the events in the Timeline pane which show the DOM being built, the CSSOM being built, and the render tree being built? (10 pts)  
    1. Parse HTML, Parse CSS, Layout  
    2. Parse HTML, Recalculate Style, Layout  
    3. Parse HTML, Recalculate Style, Paint 

    // Answer. Number 1. 

3. What is the render tree? (10 pts)
    
    // Answer. The CSSOM and DOM trees are combined into a render tree. The tree grabs only the nodes required to render the page. The layout computes the exact position and size of each object. Painting is the last stop that takes in the final render tree and renders the pixels to the screen.

4. What are three things you can do in order to speed up a website's load time? (10 pts)  

    // Answer. 1. Minify js and css files
               2. Inline csss
               3. Use async attribute on scripts or defer javascript execution

5. What is the name of the Google tool you can use to see a list of things you can do to improve your page's load speed? (10 pts)

    3. In your computer, initialize this folder as a node project.
    4. Install webpack, webpack dev server, and make sure they are saved as development dependencies in package.json

    9. Before submitting, ensure your code is bundled into one file.
    10. Commit and push to github
